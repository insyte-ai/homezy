# Tenant Renovation Rights in UAE

As a tenant in the UAE, understanding your rights and limitations regarding property modifications is essential before starting any home improvement project.

## What Tenants Can Usually Do (Without NOC)

### Minor Cosmetic Changes
- Painting walls (in same or similar colors)
- Hanging pictures and wall decor
- Installing curtain rods
- Replacing light bulbs
- Adding furniture and appliances
- Installing removable shelving

### With Restoration Clause
Some landlords allow:
- Different wall colors (with restoration commitment)
- Temporary wallpaper
- Stick-on tiles (removable)

## What Requires Landlord NOC

### Always Requires NOC
- Any structural modifications
- Permanent fixture changes
- Drilling into walls for mounting
- AC unit installation/relocation
- Kitchen or bathroom modifications
- Flooring changes
- Electrical outlet additions
- Plumbing modifications

## Getting Landlord NOC

### Steps to Follow
1. Submit written request to landlord
2. Include detailed project description
3. Attach contractor quote
4. Specify timeline
5. Get signed NOC document

### NOC Should Include
- Landlord's full name and ID
- Property details (Ejari reference)
- Scope of approved work
- Duration of approval
- Restoration requirements
- Both parties' signatures

## Lease Agreement Clauses

### What to Look For
- Modification clause
- Restoration requirements
- Security deposit implications
- Permitted vs prohibited changes

### Common Lease Terms
- "No alterations without written consent"
- "Tenant to restore at end of tenancy"
- "Landlord approval required for all fixtures"

## Financial Considerations

### Who Pays for What?
**Tenant typically pays for:**
- Cosmetic upgrades (painting, flooring)
- Additional fixtures they want
- Restoration at end of lease

**Landlord may contribute to:**
- Essential repairs (HVAC, plumbing issues)
- Improvements that add property value
- Long-term tenant incentives

### Security Deposit Impact
- Some modifications may require additional deposit
- Failure to restore can result in deposit deduction
- Document property condition before and after

## Emirates-Specific Notes

### Dubai
- Ejari registration may need updating for major changes
- RERA can mediate landlord-tenant disputes

### Abu Dhabi
- Tawtheeq registration considerations
- Municipality permits for structural work

### Other Emirates
- Local municipality rules apply
- Check with building management

## Tips for Tenants

1. **Get Everything in Writing** - Verbal agreements don't protect you
2. **Take Photos** - Document condition before modifications
3. **Keep Receipts** - Especially for improvements landlord agreed to
4. **Hire Licensed Contractors** - Protects both parties
5. **Plan for Restoration** - Budget for end-of-lease restoration
