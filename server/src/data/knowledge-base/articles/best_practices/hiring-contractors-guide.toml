# How to Hire Contractors in UAE

Finding reliable contractors in the UAE can be challenging. This guide helps you navigate the process and avoid common pitfalls.

## Before You Start

### Define Your Project Clearly
- Write detailed scope of work
- List specific materials if you have preferences
- Set realistic budget range
- Determine your timeline

### Gather Multiple Quotes
- Get at least 3-5 quotes
- Compare like-for-like (same scope)
- Be wary of quotes that are too low
- Ask for itemized breakdowns

## Vetting Contractors

### Essential Checks
1. **Trade License** - Valid UAE trade license for their service category
2. **Insurance** - Liability insurance for damages
3. **References** - Contact previous clients
4. **Portfolio** - Photos of completed projects
5. **Online Reviews** - Check Google, social media

### Red Flags to Avoid
- No trade license or expired license
- Unwilling to provide references
- Demands full payment upfront
- No written contract
- Pressure to sign immediately
- Cannot provide itemized quote
- No physical office or workshop

## The Quotation Process

### What a Good Quote Includes
- Detailed scope of work
- Material specifications and brands
- Labor costs breakdown
- Timeline with milestones
- Payment schedule
- Warranty terms
- Permit responsibility

### Comparing Quotes
| Item | Check For |
|------|-----------|
| Materials | Same brand/quality specified? |
| Labor | Similar crew size/timeline? |
| Inclusions | What's included vs extra? |
| Warranty | Coverage period and terms |

## Contracts and Agreements

### Must-Have Contract Terms
1. Full scope of work description
2. Total price and payment schedule
3. Start and completion dates
4. Penalty clause for delays
5. Change order process
6. Warranty period and coverage
7. Dispute resolution method

### Payment Structure Best Practices
- **Deposit:** 10-20% to secure booking
- **Progress payments:** Tied to milestones
- **Final payment:** 10-20% after completion and inspection
- Never pay more than 50% before work starts

## During the Project

## Common Challenges in UAE

### Language Barriers

- Use visual references (photos, drawings)

### Labor Scheduling
- Workers often juggle multiple projects
- Confirm crew availability
- Build buffer time into schedule

### Material Sourcing
- Verify materials match quotes
- Accompany contractor to buy key materials
- Keep receipts for everything

## After Completion

### Final Inspection Checklist

- Finishes are clean and professional
- All systems functional
- No damage to existing property

### Documentation to Collect

## Tips for Success

1. **Build relationships** - Good contractors are worth keeping
