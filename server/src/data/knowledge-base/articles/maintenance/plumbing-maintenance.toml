# Plumbing Maintenance for UAE Homes

UAE's water quality, building standards, and climate create unique plumbing challenges. Regular maintenance prevents costly repairs and water damage.

## UAE-Specific Plumbing Considerations

### Water Quality Issues
- High mineral content (hard water)
- Chlorine levels vary by emirate
- Salt content in some areas
- Causes limescale buildup

### Common UAE Plumbing Features
- Water tanks on roof (villa)
- Water heaters (electric storage)
- Chiller water for AC
- District cooling connections

## Monthly Maintenance Checklist

### Kitchen
- [ ] Run garbage disposal with ice cubes (cleans blades)
- [ ] Check under sink for leaks
- [ ] Clean faucet aerator (remove mineral buildup)
- [ ] Pour hot water down drains

### Bathrooms
- [ ] Check toilet for running water (lift tank lid, listen)
- [ ] Test all faucets for drips
- [ ] Clear hair from shower drain
- [ ] Check caulking around tub/shower

### Water Heater
- [ ] Check for leaks around base
- [ ] Listen for unusual sounds
- [ ] Verify temperature (50-60°C recommended)
- [ ] Note water heating time (slow = sediment buildup)

## Quarterly Maintenance

### Drain Cleaning
1. Pour boiling water down drains
2. Follow with 1/2 cup baking soda
3. Add 1/2 cup vinegar
4. Wait 15 minutes
5. Flush with hot water

### Check Water Pressure
- Normal: 40-60 PSI
- Too high: Can damage fixtures
- Too low: May indicate blockage
- Test with pressure gauge at hose bib

### Inspect Visible Pipes
- Look for corrosion (green/white buildup)
- Check for small leaks
- Feel for temperature variations
- Note any bulging or damage

## Annual Professional Service

### What Plumber Should Check
1. Water heater flush and inspection
2. Main shutoff valve operation
3. Toilet mechanisms and seals
4. All fixture connections
5. Water pressure test
6. Drain camera inspection (if issues)

### Cost: AED 200-500 for annual inspection

## Common Plumbing Problems

### Clogged Drains

**Kitchen clogs:**
- Cause: Grease, food particles
- Prevention: Never pour grease down drain
- DIY fix: Plunger, baking soda/vinegar

**Bathroom clogs:**
- Cause: Hair, soap buildup
- Prevention: Use drain covers
- DIY fix: Drain snake, chemical cleaner

**When to call plumber:**
- Multiple drains clogged
- Plunger doesn't work
- Water backing up
- Gurgling sounds

### Leaky Faucets

**Common causes:**
- Worn washer (most common)
- Corroded valve seat
- O-ring damage
- Loose parts

**DIY fix (compression faucet):**
1. Turn off water supply
2. Remove handle and packing nut
3. Replace washer and O-ring
4. Reassemble and test

**Cost if hiring:** AED 100-300 per faucet

### Running Toilet

**Diagnosis:**
1. Remove tank lid
2. Add food coloring to tank
3. Wait 15 minutes
4. Color in bowl = leak

**Common fixes:**
- Adjust float height
- Replace flapper valve (AED 20-50)
- Replace fill valve (AED 50-100)

### Low Water Pressure

**Check these first:**
1. Only one fixture? Clean aerator
2. Hot water only? Check water heater
3. Whole house? Check main valve

**Possible causes:**
- Mineral buildup in pipes
- Leaking pipe
- Pressure regulator failure
- Municipal supply issue

### Water Heater Issues

**No hot water:**
- Check thermostat setting
- Test heating element
- Check circuit breaker

**Not enough hot water:**
- Sediment buildup (needs flush)
- Undersized unit
- Heating element failing

**Strange noises:**
- Popping/rumbling = sediment (flush needed)
- Screeching = valve issue

## Emergency Plumbing

### What Constitutes Emergency
- Burst pipe
- Major leak
- No water at all
- Sewage backup
- Gas smell (call ADDC/DEWA + plumber)

### While Waiting for Plumber
1. Shut off main water valve
2. Turn off water heater
3. Open faucets to drain
4. Document damage (photos)
5. Contain water with towels/buckets

### Emergency Plumber Costs
- Call-out fee: AED 150-300
- After-hours: 50-100% surcharge
- Weekend: 25-50% surcharge

## Water-Saving Tips

### Easy Wins
- Fix dripping faucets immediately
- Install low-flow showerheads
- Use dual-flush toilet mechanisms
- Don't run water while brushing teeth

### Bigger Investments
- Tankless water heater
- Greywater recycling system
- Smart leak detectors
- Pressure-reducing valve

## Finding a Good Plumber

### Must-Haves
- Valid trade license

- Clear pricing before work
- Warranty on repairs
