# AC Maintenance Guide for UAE

In UAE's extreme climate, your AC works overtime. Proper maintenance extends lifespan, reduces energy bills, and ensures reliable cooling when you need it most.

## Why AC Maintenance Matters in UAE

### UAE-Specific Challenges
- Running 8-10 months per year
- Extreme temperature differentials (50°C outside to 22°C inside)
- High humidity causing strain
- Sand and dust infiltration
- Salt air in coastal areas

### Benefits of Regular Maintenance
- 20-30% energy savings
- Extended equipment life (15+ years vs 8-10)
- Better air quality
- Fewer emergency breakdowns
- Consistent cooling performance

## Monthly Maintenance (DIY)

### Filter Cleaning/Replacement
1. Turn off AC unit
2. Remove filter (usually behind front panel)
3. Vacuum loose dust
4. Wash with mild soap and water
5. Dry completely before reinstalling
6. Replace if damaged or every 3 months

### Visual Inspection
- Check for water leaks around unit
- Listen for unusual noises
- Verify air flow from vents
- Check thermostat accuracy

## Quarterly Maintenance

### Clean Outdoor Unit
1. Turn off power at breaker
2. Remove debris around unit
3. Gently rinse condenser coils with water
4. Straighten bent fins with fin comb
5. Ensure 2-foot clearance around unit

### Check Drain Line
- Locate condensate drain
- Pour cup of bleach/vinegar to prevent clogs
- Ensure water drains freely
- Check drip pan for standing water

## Annual Professional Service

### What Technicians Should Do
1. **Refrigerant check** - Measure and top up if needed
2. **Coil cleaning** - Deep clean evaporator and condenser
3. **Electrical inspection** - Check connections and capacitors
4. **Thermostat calibration** - Verify accurate readings
5. **Duct inspection** - Check for leaks
6. **Blower motor** - Clean and lubricate

### When to Schedule
- **Best time:** March-April (before summer)
- **Second service:** October (before winter)
- Cost: AED 150-350 per unit

## Common AC Problems

### Not Cooling Properly
**Possible causes:**
- Dirty filters (most common)
- Low refrigerant
- Frozen evaporator coil
- Faulty compressor
- Blocked condenser

**DIY fixes:**
- Clean/replace filters
- Clear debris from outdoor unit
- Check thermostat settings

### Water Leaking
**Possible causes:**
- Clogged drain line
- Frozen coil (thawing)
- Cracked drain pan
- Improper installation

**DIY fixes:**
- Clear drain line with vacuum/bleach
- Change dirty filter
- Check drain pan

### Strange Noises
| Sound | Likely Cause | Action |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Rattling | Loose parts | Tighten screws |
| Squealing | Belt issue | Call technician |
| Grinding | Motor bearings | Call technician |
| Bubbling | Refrigerant leak | Call technician |
| Clicking | Electrical issue | Call technician |

### Bad Smell
- **Musty:** Mold in ducts/unit - needs cleaning
- **Burning:** Electrical issue - turn off, call technician
- **Rotten:** Dead animal in ducts - call technician

## Energy Saving Tips

### Optimal Settings
- Set to 24°C (ideal for UAE)
- Each degree lower = 6% more energy
- Use "Auto" fan mode
- Enable sleep mode at night

### Reduce AC Load
- Close curtains during peak sun
- Seal gaps around doors/windows
- Use ceiling fans to circulate air
- Avoid heat-generating activities midday

## When to Replace Your AC

### Signs It's Time
- Over 10-12 years old
- Frequent repairs (3+ per year)
- Energy bills increasing significantly
- Uneven cooling despite repairs
- Uses R-22 refrigerant (being phased out)

### Replacement Costs (Dubai)
| Type | Unit Cost | Installation |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Window AC (1.5 ton) | AED 1,500-3,000 | AED 200-400 |
| Split AC (1.5 ton) | AED 2,500-5,000 | AED 500-800 |
| Split AC (2 ton) | AED 3,500-7,000 | AED 600-1,000 |
| Central AC | AED 15,000-40,000 | AED 3,000-8,000 |
