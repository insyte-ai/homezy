- **Voltage:** 220-240V
- **Frequency:** 50 Hz
- **Plug type:** Type G (UK-style 3-pin)
- **Circuit breakers:** Standard residential

### Common UAE Electrical Setup
- Main distribution board (DB)
- Individual circuit breakers
- ELCB/RCD for safety
- Separate AC circuits
- Dedicated water heater circuit

## Electrical Safety Rules

### The 10 Commandments of Electrical Safety

1. **Never overload outlets**
   - One high-power appliance per outlet
   - Use quality power strips with surge protection
   - Never daisy-chain extensions

2. **Keep water away**
   - No electrical items near water
   - Use GFCI outlets in bathrooms/kitchens
   - Dry hands before touching switches

3. **Don't ignore warning signs**
   - Flickering lights
   - Burning smell
   - Warm outlets
   - Sparking

4. **Use correct wattage**
   - Check light fixture ratings
   - Don't exceed appliance limits
   - LED bulbs reduce load

5. **Replace damaged cords**
   - Frayed wires are fire hazards
   - Don't tape over damage
   - Replace the cord/appliance

6. **Keep away from children**
   - Use outlet covers
   - Secure loose cords
   - Educate children on dangers

    - Don't ignore problems
    - Better safe than sorry
    - Call electrician for any concern

## Monthly Maintenance

### Visual Inspection
- [ ] Check outlets for discoloration
- [ ] Look for frayed cords
- [ ] Test light switches (smooth operation)
- [ ] Check outdoor outlets
- [ ] Inspect extension cords

### Testing Safety Devices
**RCD/ELCB Test:**
1. Press "Test" button on distribution board
2. Power should cut off
3. Reset switch
4. If test fails, call electrician immediately

**GFCI Test:**
1. Press "Test" button on outlet
2. Power should stop
3. Press "Reset" to restore
4. Test monthly

## Common Electrical Problems

### Frequent Breaker Trips

**Possible causes:**
- Overloaded circuit
- Short circuit
- Ground fault
- Faulty appliance
- Outdated wiring

**What to do:**
1. Unplug items on that circuit
2. Reset breaker
3. Add items back one by one
4. If keeps tripping, call electrician

### Flickering Lights

**Possible causes:**
| Symptom | Likely Cause |
|---------|--------------|
| One light flickers | Loose bulb or fixture |

| Flickers when appliance starts | Circuit overload |

### Warm Outlets/Switches

**This is serious. Possible causes:**
- Overloaded outlet
- Loose wiring
- Damaged outlet
- Too many items plugged in

**Action:** Stop using immediately, call electrician

### Burning Smell

**Emergency response:**
1. Turn off power at main breaker
2. Don't use any electrical

- Don't share AC outlet with other appliances
- Voltage fluctuations damage AC compressors

### Signs of AC Electrical Issues
- AC trips breaker repeatedly
- Lights dim when AC starts
- Burning smell from AC
- AC not cooling despite running

### AC Electrical Maintenance
- Annual electrical connection check
- Verify correct breaker size
- Check for loose connections
- Test emergency shut-off

## Water Heater Electrical Safety

### Important Safety Features
- Dedicated circuit required
- Timer to reduce energy use
- Temperature limit switch
- Proper grounding essential

### Warning Signs
- Water heater trips breaker
- Not heating consistently
- Burning smell
- Visible corrosion on connections

## When to Call an Electrician

### Emergency (Call Immediately)
- Burning smell
- Sparks from outlets
- Electric shock received
- Smoke from electrical
- Power completely out

### Urgent (Within 24-48 Hours)
- Frequent breaker trips
- Warm outlets or switches
- Flickering throughout house
