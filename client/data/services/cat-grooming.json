  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do cats need professional grooming?",
      "answer": "While cats self-groom, professional grooming helps with mats, long coats, nail trimming, and reduces shedding. Senior cats and long-haired breeds especially benefit from regular professional grooming."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will my cat be sedated?",
      "answer": "No, we never sedate cats. Our groomers are trained in low-stress handling techniques. For very anxious cats, we take breaks, work slowly, and may split services across multiple appointments if needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a lion cut?",
      "answer": "A lion cut shaves the body short while leaving fur on the head, tail tip, and sometimes legs, resembling a lion's mane. It's popular for long-haired cats to reduce matting and keep them cool."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should cats be groomed?",
      "answer": "Short-haired cats benefit from grooming every 6-8 weeks. Long-haired cats may need grooming every 4-6 weeks to prevent mats. Regular nail trims are recommended every 2-3 weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you groom aggressive or nervous cats?",
      "answer": "Yes, our groomers have experience with difficult cats. We use gentle restraint techniques and work at the cat's pace. Extremely aggressive cats may need veterinary grooming for safety."
