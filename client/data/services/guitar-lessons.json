    {
      "question": "What type of guitar should I start with?",
      "answer": "Most beginners start with acoustic guitar as it builds finger strength and doesn't require additional equipment. If you're passionate about rock or metal, starting on electric is fine too."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to read music?",
      "answer": "No, many guitarists learn through tablature (tabs) and chord diagrams. However, we can teach traditional music notation if you're interested or preparing for exams."
    },
    {
      "question": "What age can children start guitar?",
      "answer": "Children can begin around age 6-7 when their hands are large enough to form chords. Smaller guitars (3/4 size) are available for young players."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until I can play songs?",
      "answer": "Most students can play simple songs within the first few lessons. With regular practice, you'll be playing more complex songs within a few months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you teach bass guitar?",
      "answer": "Yes, we have instructors who specialize in bass guitar. Bass lessons cover technique, groove, rhythm, and playing in a band context."
