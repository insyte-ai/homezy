  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a fit out and a renovation?",
      "answer": "Fit outs involve completing the interior of a bare or shell space—adding flooring, ceilings, partitions, MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing) works, and final finishes. Renovation typically means updating or remodeling an already finished space."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do fit out contractors also offer design and planning services?",
      "answer": "Yes, many UAE-based fit out contractors offer end-to-end solutions, including interior design, 3D visualizations, space planning, and authority approvals."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a typical fit out project take in the UAE?",
      "answer": "Timelines vary by project, but most office and residential fit outs in the UAE are completed within 4 to 12 weeks, depending on size, approvals, and complexity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are turnkey fit outs cost-effective?",
      "answer": "Turnkey fit outs can save both time and costs by streamlining design, build, and project management into a single, integrated service—minimizing delays and miscommunication."
