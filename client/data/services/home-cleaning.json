      "question": "How often should I schedule home cleaning services?",
      "answer": "The frequency depends on your household's needs. For homes with children, pets, or high traffic, weekly cleaning is recommended. For smaller households or less frequent use, bi-weekly or monthly services may be sufficient. We offer flexible scheduling to accommodate your specific needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between regular cleaning and deep cleaning?",
      "answer": "Regular cleaning focuses on maintaining cleanliness through routine tasks like dusting, vacuuming, mopping, and surface cleaning in kitchens and bathrooms. Deep cleaning is more thorough and includes all regular cleaning tasks plus detailed attention to areas that aren't cleaned regularly, such as behind appliances, inside cabinets, baseboards, ceiling fans, window tracks, scale removal, and more."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to provide cleaning supplies?",
      "answer": "No, our cleaning teams bring all necessary professional-grade cleaning supplies and equipment. We use eco-friendly products that are effective yet safe for your family and pets. If you prefer specific products or have special requirements due to allergies or preferences, please let us know in advance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does a typical cleaning service take?",
      "answer": "The duration depends on the size of your home and the type of service. For a standard 2-bedroom apartment, regular cleaning typically takes 2-3 hours with a team of two cleaners. Deep cleaning the same space might take 4-5 hours. Larger homes or those requiring specialized services will take longer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to be home during the cleaning service?",
      "answer": "It's not necessary to be present during the cleaning service. Many clients provide a key or arrange for building access. However, for first-time services, we recommend being present at the beginning to discuss specific requirements and at the end to inspect the results. All our cleaning professionals are thoroughly vetted, background-checked, and insured for your peace of mind."
